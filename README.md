# BlackThroughTimeAndSpace Chrome Extension

**Version 1.0.0**

Basic Chrome browser Extension Implementation

Replaces some images on a webpage with images of beautiful people through time and space... You know - Black People.

P.S: It gets rather annoying after you use it for a while. Especially on YouTube.
